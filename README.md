### Checking Our Understanding
1) No. Sending a message touches UI, networking, authentication and storage, so it belongs in integration or end-to-end tests rather than a unit test.
2) Yes. Enforcing an 80-character cap is a small, self-contained function, so unit tests give fast, reliable feedback on that logic.
